## ToDo:
O - make all of the words in the bio clickable and link to works
O - even out all of the spacing
O - add links in readme and links to github
O - highlight stuff in the intro
O - make the background of the site's dots be connected sometimes, add like a little snake or a few that go around between the dots
O - make it responsive
O - even out font sizes

### Background:
O - start with one array of lines ( updates each time the window is resized )
O - just rotate the dots on mousemove event
O - longer lines coming from the dots based on the distance from the cursor ( it will be like max( minLength, dist / maxDist * maxLength) )
