## Genetic Algorithm TODO

> the longer the simulation is running, the lower the framerate becomes so figure out some way to fight this

> basically have each chromosome be an x and y and have a setInterval function running in the background
> that updates their velocities every couple of seconds

> each time user clicks the start button it changes the variable that is used to iterate through every rocket, which ends
> up causing OOB error, so either change it so it loops through population.length or find another fix later

> change up the way the chromosome iteration works because that function will be running forever and the timing might be off since its not connected
> to when the actual frames are updated because its a setInterval, so this might make it inconsistent
> possibly just start it when the start button is pressed and then unbind it when the generation finishes with its moves [unbind interval here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/109086/stop-setinterval-call-in-javascript)

> make it so the fitness algorithm takes into account the time it takes for the rocket to reach the goal as well

> start with simple crossover and mutation algorithms but then make them more complicated as development progresses

> might have to change the init function to use constructors instead so that i can use the genes generated by crossover functions and mutation

> possibly change it so that each time init() is called, the board object is deleted and recreated so that frames are not lost over time?

> add in functionality for changing the size of the asteroids and where they are placed on the screen
> and more customizability

> make the fitness algorithm more random and not always the top 4

> create a workaround for the fact that once they get through all their moves, they die, but this shouldn't be the case

> overwrite the same variables so that no new memory is used

> change allDead to instead rely on if the rocket is dead or if the rocket is done with its moves

> add in a line chart for the generational average fitness with d3.js

> make it so they can drag
